# Outdated Project

Since I was really newbie when I made this project, the project's file structure isn't that great for maintainability and best practices are rarely used in this project.
Although, the code worked fine, I still had a long way to the perfection then.

**Important note: in this project all of the business logics are inside the routers, but it's a really bad practice. In my recent projects (private yet) I always make controllers and I put the business logic inside the controller files.**
